The application checks for Domain Error and Enforces HTTPs.
Also implemented Rate limiting where it allows user to create only 10 shortened URL in 30 mins.
It also checks whether the shortened URL is already taken by any other user
Used Docker to deploy/build in a container
Used Docker compose in order to deploy 2 docker containers (Application & Redis database)
After the URL is shortened, User can use the shortened URL to redirect it to the actual website for 24 hours.`,
